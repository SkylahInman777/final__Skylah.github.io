		<h2>The Pepperoni Incident</h2>
		</div>
		<p> is all begins with rina and Jamie, Linds' boyfriend, sitting in a room together. Rina says she is feeling hungry so she asks Jamie if she should eat the pepperoni in the fridge, and he says, "no, thats Linds'." so instead of eating the pepperoni, she starts pouring wasibi into her mouth. Jamie is all like, "no no! its fine eat some pepperoni!" and all while this is happening they are sending videos back and forth with Linds. linds is telling them not to eat the pepperoni, but it is too late, Rina has already eaten a pepperoni. However, they don't see the video of Linds telling rina not to eat any until after it has been done. shortly after the deed has been done, they see the video Linds has send, and decide to make a pact not to tell her. however, when jamie leaves the room to go let linds into the building, he breaks that pact almost imedietly and tells linds of the two pepperoni Rina has eaten. after telling Linds of the crime they had commited, he runds back to the room and locks linds out of the room. this is the start of Linds' irritation. she tells Jamie to let her back into the room, and when he finally does, she starts joke yellling at rina bout the pepperoni, "why would you eat my pepperoni!?" she says. and she continues to yell like this until the joke yelling, turns into real yelling. linds reealizes what she has done, so exsuses herself from the room. Rina in the meantime is pooping her pants because her roomate is not angry at her. so in a state of panic, she puts a ten dollar bill on the pepperoni for linds to take later. but then linds comes back into the room, grabs her coat and shoes and leaves without saying a word. Jamie and rina are still poopong their pants, but end up going to the music building with her a few minutes later. they all ended up avoiding eachother while in the building together that night. anyway, they fought for like a week about the pepperoni and Rina might move out now. they say they are made up, but are they really? find out next week in this very section of the blog. </p>
