<p>On a fine summer day, my friends and I decided to go swimming at the blue mesa reservoir. However, this fine day was not so fine. There was so much wind that it felt like it could blow you over, there was so much wind it created waves in the lake, there was so much wind that if someone went into the water, they would probably drown and die. you would be crazy to get in and go deep enough to actually start swimming.... right? WELL I'M CRAZY!!!! There was an island in the middle of the lake and new character Brian and I thought would be a great thing to swim to. And so, on our journey we went. We walked around the sand for like half a mile until we got to a point where we thought the current of the waves would be able to push us to the island. On our way, we found many treasures. but we had to start swimming eventually. we jumped into the lake, and the waves took us. I was sure I would drown about five times, but eventually, we made it!!! We named the island, Ooga Booga island. After exploring, a while, it was time to let the waves take us back to the mainland. a few of our treasures getting crushed later, Brian and I make it back.</p>

<p> Imagine being so bored that you decide to make a movie. Late night thoughts are really intrusive, and seem to have won against us. About a week ago, my friends and I decided to make this awful yet amazing movie. It started with Rina and I, (yâ€™all met this character last blog) taking her long board to the very empty skate park. We were both horrible skateboarders, but that didn't stop up from speeding around and being silly. Eventually, we pulled our phones out and started recording goofy moments. But then, Rina, was like, "hey, wanna make a movie?" and I was like, "hell yeah I do." Lately, I have been obsessed with the Surfs up movie, so that is where my inspiration came from. The movie was in the back of my mind the whole time while improvising every line and scene. ANYWAY Rina and I were having a grand ol' time, when two more of our friends showed up. Brian, and new character Linds. They were so iconic in helping us film everything and even acting a few parts (a few as in... one. Rina and I acted in pretty much everything :,)). And so, this masterpiece was born. PLEASE WATCH ALL NINE MINUTES AND TWENTY FOUR SECONDS OF IT, IT IS SO GOOD!!!!

		<h3> Side Character Arch</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="flex-grid">
	<p> Every Tuesday night, Brian and I have to go to the NCAA required study hall. I'm not really sure why we have to go to it, but i guess it keeps us smart. anyway, earlier that day Brian was telling me about how he sat down on a couch and his airpods fell out of his pocket and the couch ate them. I told him that he should just go look in the couch, but he wanted to wait until no one was around to rip apart this poor couch. anyway, I think he may have looked there a few times without being able to find them. However, then a couple of hours later he comes to me and is like, 
	"My AirPods are in pinnacles." so someone took them, great!!! and then he was like, "After study hall want to go try and find them with me?" and I was like, "Of course, side character adventure part four." </p>
	<p> So on the adventure we went. with AirPods you can connect them to your phone and track them down, so with whatever app it was, we followed the map to the pods. we went through this dorm building floor to floor, holding the phone up in the air in hopes they would connect to them. finally, we get to the third floor. and in the middle of the hallway, they connect for a split second, Brian starts playing the noise and we listen into people's doors in hopes of hearing them, but then they disconnect. we think we have found the room they're in, but we are too afraid to knock. but then someone with this really cute dog starts going into the room across from the room we think they are in. We look to this girl with the dog and go, "Are the people that live in that room nice?" and she's like, "Yeah." so with the little courage we have, we knock on the door. they yell for us to come in but we yell back, "But we're strangers, and the door is locked!" so they come to open the door and we ask about the AirPods. they don't have them. </p>
	<p> I look to Brian and go, "What if they're right above us?" and we sprint up to the fourth floor. the AirPods then connect again and Brian starts playing the noise. we go door to door pressing our ears up against them to try and hear the airpods when finally, we hear the dingging. we go over to the door across the hall to make sure the noise isn't coming from there, and then head back to the room. we knock on the door once, and then we knock on it three more times really loudly, and we keep playing the noise over and over again until we head a door from the inside open. then we hear footsteps and another door open. then the sound of the AirPods getting closer. this random guy then opens the door, drops the airpods, scattering them across the floor, and then to top it off, some random puppy runs out of the room. the guy picks up the airpods and is like, "oh, thats Odie, hes not supposed to be here." about the dog, then goes "are these yours? they were in my roomates room." and Brian is like, "yeah hahah, we've been looking everywhere for them." so, we talk with this dude for a second about our adventure, when the door shuts behind him and he goes, "oh shoot, i just locked myself out." and the dog that isn't supposed to be there is still in the hallway! so this guy picks up the dog and says, "come on odie, we're going to the neighbors." and then he just leavs. so then brian and I do too.
